# BeginnerChess
A simple, open source chess engine written in java by a beginner. https://thealaskalinuxuser.wordpress.com

 * A special note of credit goes to https://sites.google.com/site/jonathanwarkentinlogiccrazy/ Jonathan Warkentin's (Logic Crazy) great tutorial of making your own chess engine. A lot of the chess logic comes from his tutorial, and at first, I just found a way to port it to a format that was useful for Android.

 * Now I am attempting to edit it and take my own meager skills as a programmer to the next level.
